# Movie Genre Trends and Ratings Analysis (2005â€“2025)

This project explores how movie genres have evolved over the past 20 years based on IMDb data. It aims to uncover patterns in genre popularity, audience engagement, and movie ratings.

## Objectives

- Identify genres with the highest average ratings
- Analyze shifts in genre popularity over time
- Examine audience engagement through number of votes
- Observe rating trends across years
- Showcase top-rated movies within the most popular genres

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset

The dataset was originally available on Kaggle (now unavailable). A local version was preserved for this analysis. It includes:

- `title`, `type`, `genres`, `averageRating`, `numVotes`, `releaseYear`, etc.
